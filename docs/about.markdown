Currently based in Paris, I am a first year student in Master of Data Sciences & Business Analytics at ESSEC & CentraleSup√©lec, I first developed my love for all things data as a data analyst in banking in 2018. I left Australia in 2020 to dedicate my full attention to learning the field.     

I believe that we can use data better to optimize the way we work, customer experience and translate data into higher profitability; the future is data driven.

In my spare time I like to explore Paris and try new bakeries every weekend, travel when I can and try to learn French.
