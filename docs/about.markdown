Currently based in Paris, I am a second year Master of Data Sciences & Business Analytics student at ESSEC & CentraleSup√©lec. I first developed my love for all things data in 2018 when I chanced upon a data analytics role at Australia and New Zealand Bank, and I left Australia in 2020 to dedicate my full attention to learning as much as possible in the field which led me to Paris.     

I believe that we can use data better to optimize the way we work, revolutionize customer experience and translate data into higher profitability; the future is data driven.

In my spare time I like to explore Paris and its bakeries every weekend, travel when I can and I am currently learning French.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have data-related needs for your business. I am also open to internship or full-time opportunities available starting July 2022.
